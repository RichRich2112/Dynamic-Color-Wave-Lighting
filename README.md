# Dynamic Color Wave Lighting for Hubitat

An advanced ambient lighting application for the Hubitat Elevation platform. This app creates immersive, shifting environments by dynamically cycling coordinated color profiles across your selected smart bulbs with smooth wave transitions. 

It is designed to work seamlessly with **Z-Wave, Zigbee, and Matter RGBW bulbs**. It features robust event suppression to filter out self-generated commands across all protocols, an optional state capture/restore machine, physical or virtual button controllers to easily trigger or cancel the effects, and dynamic theme cycling via button holds with mobile push notifications.

**Note:** I'm using Linkind LS01018-RGBTW-WB-US bulbs. You may need to tweak the color numbers for hue, saturation, etc if your bulbs are not displaying the schemes to your satisfaction.

## Features

* **11 Curated Color Profiles:** Instantly shift the mood with everything from natural atmospheric cycles to vibrant reactive palettes.
* **On-the-Fly Theme Cycling:** Hold a designated button on a physical or virtual button controller, mid-loop, to immediately hop to the next color profile without stopping the active wave.
* **Mobile Push Notifications:** In-app UI option: Instantly sends a push alert via the Hubitat mobile app to your phone whenever a theme is cycled, keeping you informed of the active state.
* **Intelligent State Recovery:** Captures the exact state of your bulbs before an effect starts (including Power, Hue, Saturation, Level, and Color Temperature) and gracefully restores them when stopped.
* **Multi-Protocol Event Suppression:** Filters out self-generated Z-Wave, Zigbee, and Matter status updates to keep the hub running smoothly during rapid transitions.
* **External Override Protection:** Automatically stops the animation loop if a user manually turns off a bulb, adjusts the physical switch, or changes the color configuration via a dashboard or physical controller.
* **Granular Timing Control:** Configure the individual bulb transition intervals and overall cycle pause durations to fine-tune the speed of the wave.
* **Dual Activation Methods:** Run the loop via an integrated master virtual/physical switch or map it directly to push/hold/double-tap events on a button controller.

## Configuration

* **Color Bulbs:** Choose the target `capability.colorControl` devices (Z-Wave, Zigbee, or Matter RGBW) you want included in the effect. Unselected color bulbs on the network will automatically turn off when the loop activates to maintain ambient immersion.
* **Theme Configuration:** Select your baseline profile.
* **Set a bulb every (seconds):** The delay between updating individual bulbs in the sequence. Lower numbers make the "wave" move faster across your room.
* **Then pause (seconds):** The wait time after an entire wave has rolled through before shuffling the device order and firing the next wave.
* **Base Effect Brightness:** Sets the brightness (dim) level (1-100%) for the bulbs. Profiles like *Candlelight* and *Ember & Hearth* will dynamically scale below this number to simulate physical flickering.

### Automated Triggers & Notifications (Optional)
* **Switch Control:** Associating
